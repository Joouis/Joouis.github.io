    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways:"></a>Key Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>The locally deployed open-source model Qwen2.5-72B outperforms GPT-4o with Cline.</li><li>A more general instruction-tuned model is preferable over coding&#x2F;math-specific versions when using Cline.</li><li>Improvements in model performance could enhance other tools, such as OpenHands, which I plan to try next.</li></ul><h3 id="Exploring-the-Coding-Agent-Landscape"><a href="#Exploring-the-Coding-Agent-Landscape" class="headerlink" title="Exploring the Coding Agent Landscape"></a>Exploring the Coding Agent Landscape</h3><p>Recently, one of the hottest topics has been coding agents. Our team explored the Cursor and Windsurf editors (both forks of VS Code) and found them to be amazing! Their capabilities, including code quality, response speed, automation, and less human feedback, are superior to the GitHub Copilot extension on VS Code. It’s not surprising that Cursor and Windsurf can easily outperform GitHub Copilot (and Cline + GPT-4o which I’ll introduce soon), as these products have comprehensive optimizations, including post-trained models, customized prompts, RAG, etc. However, they also come with privacy and security risks.</p><p>To adopt a coding assistant while meeting compliance requirements, the Cline extension with the GPT-4o service provided by Azure AI is an excellent option. We are grateful for the leadership team’s encouragement and support in utilizing this tool.</p><h3 id="My-Short-Journey-with-Cline-AOAI-GPT-4o"><a href="#My-Short-Journey-with-Cline-AOAI-GPT-4o" class="headerlink" title="My Short Journey with Cline + AOAI GPT-4o"></a>My Short Journey with Cline + AOAI GPT-4o</h3><p>I started using Cline + AOAI GPT-4o to replace Cursor right after the callout email. However, like my teammates, I found its performance below expectations. The setup process was complicated with unclear configurations and TPM rate limits, and its capabilities were far inferior to Cursor&#x2F;Windsurf. It also suffered from stability issues, including extended hangups (over 5 minutes) and code 500 request errors. The downgraded experience was disappointing for an aspiring engineer.</p><p>GPT-4o should be the best model we can use so far, we can only choose AOAI models from the base model list. Although o1-preview is also on the list, applications are required, and there is a lengthy wait for approval. While creating the GPT-4o deployment on Azure AI Foundry, I noticed that fine-tuned models were “available”. This made me wonder if other models on Azure AI might be both compliant and superior to GPT-4o. Public leaderboards could answer the performance question, though verification would take effort. Azure AI only offers fine-tuning tool, which isn’t ideal for our case. Azure AI Foundry’s Model catalog presents another opportunity with its many popular models, but I lacked both quota and budget to experiment. Faced with either using a mediocre tool or leaving an idea unverified, I decided to locally deploy the open-source Qwen2.5 model.</p><h3 id="Deployment-and-Testing"><a href="#Deployment-and-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Deployment and Testing"></a>Deployment and Testing</h3><p>I deployed the official Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-AWQ model using vLLM, and the process went smoothly. Even configuring Cline proved easier than with AOAI. For smaller tasks, the model performs on par with GPT-4o. For project-level challenges like “write a Tetris game for the web using TypeScript”, its planning and reasoning capabilities surpass GPT-4o. I tested both models a few times for this task - Qwen2.5 consistently provided similar, rough, and workable versions with few rounds of human feedback, while GPT-4o only succeeded once. Both outputs were buggy and required multiple rounds of instructions to refine.</p><p>The response speed for both models is about the same, which is acceptable to me. The token usage for Qwen2.5 always shows as 0, which might be a bug, but the log sizes for both models are comparable. While scaling up usage might reveal new challenges, the service and quality of Qwen2.5 currently meet my needs.</p><p>Initially, I tried Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct because of its high download ranking and coding purpose, but it occasionally struggled with Cline prompts. There is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gpqhgu/qwen_25_32b_coder_doesnt_handle_the_cline_prompt/">similar issue</a> discussed on Reddit. I also noticed that Cline supports DeepSeek, which has received glowing feedback from colleagues about its DeepSeek-V3 commercial version. However, its MoE architecture with 685B parameters makes it impractical for typical personal use.</p><h3 id="Scaling-Up-for-Team-Deployment"><a href="#Scaling-Up-for-Team-Deployment" class="headerlink" title="Scaling Up for Team Deployment"></a>Scaling Up for Team Deployment</h3><p>I’m happy with my local server now, but how can I generalize it to the whole team? I guess the solution still lies with Azure AI model service. Interestingly, while Phi-4 is a Microsoft model, we’re unable to use it directly on Azure AI. Perhaps Microsoft is too deeply tied to OpenAI. If it’s possible to reallocate a portion of the AOAI compute quotas to deploy some of these wonderful open-source models, things would be different.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Time-to-navigate-the-frontier"><a href="#Time-to-navigate-the-frontier" class="headerlink" title="Time to navigate the frontier"></a>Time to navigate the frontier</h2><p>In the dynamic landscape of Large Language Models (LLM), our team is once again at the cutting edge, pioneering a new venture called <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow">Prompt flow</a> (PF). My role transcends the rapid and high-quality delivery of products. I need to contemplate the features that can deliver real values to our customers and the user experience that resonates with the essence of those features. This new challenge is substantial for a web front-end engineer and has been a focal point of my professional contemplation.</p><p>As 2023 drew to a close, a fortuitous invitation from a university peer led me to explore the synergy between LLMs and conventional ML models. This exploration transformed me into an amateur researcher, granting me the privilege to scrutinize the research process through our customers’ lens, with the aim of pinpointing their pain points to better inform our product design.</p><h2 id="Recent-academic-work-I-learned-from"><a href="#Recent-academic-work-I-learned-from" class="headerlink" title="Recent academic work I learned from"></a>Recent academic work I learned from</h2><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13414">This paper</a> has been accepted by ACL 2024 Findings few days ago, a great encouragement for us. <strong>Please read the full paper if you’re interested in details, which will not be interpreted here</strong>.</p><h4 id="Harnessing-LLMs-as-post-hoc-correctors"><a href="#Harnessing-LLMs-as-post-hoc-correctors" class="headerlink" title="Harnessing LLMs as post-hoc correctors"></a>Harnessing LLMs as post-hoc correctors</h4><p>A fixed LLM is leveraged to propose corrections to an arbitrary ML model’s predictions without additional training or the need for additional datasets.</p><p><img data-src="/images/from-research-to-product-customer-insights-on-prompt-flow/1-concept.png" alt="Figure 1: Harnessing LLMs as post-hoc correctors.

Naturally, I endeavored to integrate it into our research, yet reality diverged from my original intentions. Hence, let’s see these few reflections on PF throughout the research journey. Please note that most of our works were done before early February of 2024, so I don’t mean to be a monday morning quarterback for some points.</p><h3 id="1-Support-and-optimization-of-local-inference-experience-will-gain-more-customer-favor"><a href="#1-Support-and-optimization-of-local-inference-experience-will-gain-more-customer-favor" class="headerlink" title="1. Support and optimization of local inference experience will gain more customer favor"></a>1. Support and optimization of local inference experience will gain more customer favor</h3><p>Most researchers and engineers have certain computational resources, and from the perspective of cost control, they are likely to choose open-source large language models (LLMs) for local inference work, which PF does not support. We have similar story that opted for LLMs like Llama at the beginning of the experiment, which meant giving up on PF.</p><h3 id="2-Flex-mode-is-crucial-for-the-use-of-flow"><a href="#2-Flex-mode-is-crucial-for-the-use-of-flow" class="headerlink" title="2. Flex mode is crucial for the use of flow"></a>2. Flex mode is crucial for the use of flow</h3><p>Despite transitioning to OpenAI’s GPT3.5&#x2F;4 models, our repository was already rich with Python utilities and Jupyter notebooks, complemented by a wealth of projects from previous research endeavors. The core competitive edge of PF aside, the availability of flex mode at that juncture would have allowed for an exploratory integration with our established GNN workflow, potentially igniting a synergistic spark.</p><h3 id="3-Is-Prompt-engineering-really-that-important"><a href="#3-Is-Prompt-engineering-really-that-important" class="headerlink" title="3. Is Prompt engineering really that important?"></a>3. Is Prompt engineering really that important?</h3><p>The value of our work lies in placing LLM to an interesting position with right work in the system to maximize its value. The prompts designed and used are relatively common today: simple structure, essential knowledge and few-shots. Therefore prompt engineering have not played the key role in this work.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that PF recently launched the Prompty feature, which provides quick access and focuses on the value of tuning prompts. This may be practical in large engineering applications, where the content of a single prompt can range from hundreds to thousands of lines. If the scenario holds, then support complex Jinja Template Designer features and preview the final prompt content will be of great help (just like Overleaf does).</p><h3 id="4-What-PF-did-right"><a href="#4-What-PF-did-right" class="headerlink" title="4. What PF did right?"></a>4. What PF did right?</h3><p>When we began to learn and try to implement RAG App, we naturally looked at some LangChain samples first, then… went from beginner to giving up. My teammate chose the OpenAI Playground to use the GPT4 Assistants feature, meanwhile Azure OpenAI had not supported Assistants yet, so I chose to build a RAG flow following the PF sample. In this scenario, there are a few advantages to note:</p><ul><li>Low-code is always easy to build PoC.</li><li>Orchestration to do batch run.</li><li>Tracing (Not implemented yet at that time, but definitely a keeper feature).</li></ul><p>Of course, there are also points worth discussing, such as whether you still need to write some code that will affect the ease of use assessment if it is not clear in the sample that embeddings are generated using the same model set and stored in the vector database; or the data input and output in the batch run scenario, which also involves a lot of manual work.</p><p>Another aside, the performance of File retrieval of OpenAI (OAI) Assistants was not satisfactory at that time. I wonder if there has been a significant improvement after it was renamed to File Search now.</p><h3 id="5-What-should-PF-focus-on-if-it-conducts-Experiments"><a href="#5-What-should-PF-focus-on-if-it-conducts-Experiments" class="headerlink" title="5. What should PF focus on if it conducts Experiments?"></a>5. What should PF focus on if it conducts Experiments?</h3><p>Firstly, there are some old topics, such as experiment status display and refresh, CRUD operations and viewing logs at each step, which are essential features of various products.</p><p>When the amount of experimental data is huge, limitations on metrics like RPM and TPM will start to trouble users. Thus, how to estimate the number of tokens and requests for experiments under these constraints by services like OAI and Azure OpenAI (AOAI) to achieve automated high-concurrency scheduling, and even support multi-endpoints concurrency, will be a great value to customer. In previous experiments, we implemented very basic token calculation and request interval logic, and I believe we are not the only ones with such needs.</p><h2 id="Last-few-words"><a href="#Last-few-words" class="headerlink" title="Last few words"></a>Last few words</h2><p>It’s not commonly encouraged for engineers to delve into academic pursuits, since not everyone possesses the passion, foundation, or even time. However, in the era of Generative AI, immersing oneself in scholarly articles is always a wise move!</p><p>Whether in practical application or academic experimentation, only through in-depth engagement can one truly understand and unearth the pain points of users. I believe this embodies the spirit of our current discussion.</p>]]></content>

promotion~”这个梗，只能说大家都深受传统东亚职场文化荼毒已久 XD</p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!38375&authkey=!AKA7Y3VKta9EZQc&width=1500&height=2000"></p><h2

吉他之神的演唱会！</h2><p>买完东西已经五点出头，中间花了不少时间在微信沟通上。等我们到武道馆时已经五点半，看起来是没时间吃正餐了，便利店饭团解决吧。吃饭团前腹中感到不适，立马冲去路边的公共厕所大号。结果这个厕所着实让我震惊，非常干净，没什么异味。要是偏远地段或者高级商场里的厕所就算了，这就是一个普通的路边厕所，并且靠近九段下地铁站，人流和使用量非常大，下午五点半居然能保持这么好？！当下在微信上跟对象说，虽然听起来像国内公知说的话，但这个厕所甚至比我们家的还干净…</p><p>出来后还发现马路对面居然是靖国神社，那正好把这泡屎送给供奉在里面的战犯们~</p><p><img

Bramhall II都已54岁，键盘手Chris Stainton更是79岁高龄，有着赫赫履历的一群大师！总觉得光头佬很眼熟，看到名字直拍大腿，原来是Nathan East——音乐史上参与录音最多的贝斯手之一。之前总是在网上的各种演出视频中见到，没想到他也是Eric的老伙伴。这场演出绝对物超所值！</p><p><img

Carrack各唱一首歌便彻底谢幕。原本以为作为东京演唱会的最后一场老克会有更多表演回馈粉丝，不过了解他们的年龄后表示理解，这个岁数还能在舞台上近乎完美地表演一个半小时，很难要求更多。</p><p>这是我第一次出国看演唱会，也是第一次现场看全球顶级巨星、吉他英雄的演出，今生难忘！当时在朋友圈感叹道：</p><blockquote><p>圆梦2023之老克演唱会，顶级的老克、顶级的乐队、顶级的观众，几乎完美的观看体验！不是老克的粉丝，但传奇的魅力无法阻挡！今晚最佳个人投《I shot the sheriff》，但用《Wonderful tonight》给日本之行画下句号再合适不过。</p><p>震撼，精彩！</p></blockquote><p>大家有序退场后，我们与Eyama的朋友一起吃了顿印度菜，顺便了解了一点日本大学生毕业后的工作生活状况。听上去名校毕业生在国际大公司工作光鲜亮丽，实际在东京这样的大都市甚至会入不敷出。赚得多花得也多，和北上深挺像的。</p><p>依稀记得这是永田町站的换乘电梯。</p><p><img

class="headerlink" title="04.25 东京Google办公室长什么样？"></a>04.25 东京Google办公室长什么样？</h2><p>东京的最后一个行程也尤为精彩，那便是参观谷歌在涩谷的办公室。来之前我们本想在涩谷站取返回大阪的新干线高铁票，但不知为何Visa卡付款一直有问题，远程求助Lq君无果，她直接杀下楼帮我们重买两张票。再一看行李寄存柜的价格，算了还是托管在办公室的前台吧。</p><p>和贵软的中年企业风相比，谷歌办公室的风格更加年轻时尚，符合我们对互联网大厂的期待。</p><p><img

返程"></a>04.25 返程</h3><p>最后剩下返程之旅。我们先坐地铁到品川，接着乘坐新干线返回大阪。不得不说当初拒绝Eyama乘坐夜间大巴往返是多么明智的决定，虽然新干线不便宜，但舒适度比夜间大巴高出无数个档次，何况参观谷歌办公室的体验更是难得。</p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!38433&authkey=!AGTlTTC3tnxYWHg&width=2000&height=1500"></p><p>新干线列车和国内的高铁感觉差不多。</p><p><img

data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!38440&authkey=!AEIwCuJtmB9Mr_8&width=2000&height=1500"></p><p>值机时还遇到一点小麻烦，航司要求所有乘客出示纸质版的核酸检测报告，Eyama有点走不动了，只好让他看着行李我去找便利店打印。结果航站楼内的便利店没有打印机，店员告诉我要去对面楼的全家才有。火急火燎跑过去之后，前面有个国人小姐姐正在操作，但她的苹果手机连不上打印机，而我的三星没问题但身上没有硬币现金。她主动帮我投了币，我也义不容辞帮她打印了证明。</p><p>我俩风尘仆仆赶回值机柜台时，原本排着的长队已经走光，我们随后也顺利办完手续登机。落地上海已是夜里十一点半，等到停车场的接驳车把我们接回停车场差不多十二点。来时是Eyama开得车，回程就由我来一路狂飙了。因为是Eyama的车，开回苏州他家小区门口之后，我还需要再打车花费约半小时才能到家。苏州没有机场真得太伤，一口气赶十二小时的路太伤。</p><p>无论如何，第一次日本之行到此圆满告一段落，除了没有背一把吉他回来外其余目标全都达成。增长了很多见识，对日本IT业职场也有了一丁点浅薄的认知。感慨对于有钱人来说，在日本当一个外国人（不融入当地文化）生活很爽，既有发达国家的基建、产业优势，同时又兼具安全、好服务等一些欧美国家被诟病缺乏的东西。</p><p>五年多次签证不能白办，以后还会常来看看~</p>]]></content>

徒步往返大阪城</h2><p>今天是未曾设想的超级特种兵的一天，且听我慢慢道来。</p><p>早上八点五十，赶在酒店早餐收摊之前浅尝了一下，只能说很有地方特色 :)</p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!38256&authkey=!AMMGM0j9ywYgSPU&width=2000&height=1500"></p><p>吃完我们便出发前往今日唯一景点——大阪城。需要说明从心斋桥往返大阪城我们几乎全程步行，因为Eyama对Hello Cycling的电动自行车有莫名的执念，沿路查看每个停车点有无车辆。结果所有网点都没有超过一辆可以正常使用的自行车，导致我们走了绝大多数路程。随后由于距离近、走街串巷，依然徒步在心斋桥附近逛琴行、逛商店街以及找吃的。最终手机上破纪录地显示今天走了<strong>18.78公里</strong>…</p><p>祸不单行，到了晚上我开始感到脸烫头晕，一开始还以为过度疲劳导致发烧，后面几天才意识到，我居然晒伤了！还是太年轻，完全没想到大阪的紫外线如此强烈… 而Eyama，他戴了帽子😂。</p><p>那么开始今天的city walk吧。</p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!38257&authkey=!APTUx8LDhl7td0M&width=1500&height=2000"></p><p><img

支线任务失败 :(</p><p>这不仅需要Eyama当下再从Tabelog找一家附近的店，同时也无意中加大了当日行走量以及为晒伤埋下伏笔。在公园阴凉处稍息片刻，Eyama决定午餐吃一家步行十几分钟距离的大阪烧，既然选择权交给他我自然同意。</p><p>到店差点破防，今日店内不接客。好在店家还做外卖，我们可以买了带去附近的7-11吃。</p><p><img

日本逛琴行初体验</h2><p>逛琴行自然是我的提议，这次旅行我们接连考察了大阪和东京的Ikebe分店。在网上看了许久的逛琴行节目，并且经常能在闲鱼上刷到职业卖家在日本收得中古琴，我自然也想体验一把捡漏。于是乎提前在网上查到这家日本较大的连锁琴行，并在其官网看好几把电吉他等着线下验证。</p><p>IKebe心斋桥的分店略显拥挤。一楼是各种配件以及单块效果器，感觉价格并没有比国内便宜。最大的收获是见到一块售价三万多人民币（698000 JPY）的金马Klon，拍完才发现标价牌上写着 “No Picture”（抱歉！），就不放出来了。</p><p><img

从高分咖啡店到高分荞麦面店</h2><p>我们早上离开酒店前已经办理了退房，行李则寄存在酒店，毕竟临近地铁晚上去大阪车站方便。回酒店之前我跟Eyama分开行动，他想吃点东西补充能量，而我想买杯咖啡休息一下。在Google Map上看到附近有家评分非常高的Mel Coffee，单程步行十分钟，此时已经不太走得动，犹豫片刻本着“来都来了”的指导思想还是冲了。</p><p>这家店门面不大，到的时候已经有几个人在排队，店员拿着菜单挨个询问客人点单。比较有趣的是菜单分日文和英文两种，店员看到我时一句话没问直接递给我英文版，犀利预判我不是日本人😆。</p><p><img

El Platanillo Geisha。然而我不太能喝出咖啡的好坏，欣赏水平还停留在香醇微甜的“初级阶段”，因此很难评价这杯咖啡到底如何，印象中属于不难喝但也不好喝的那种。随咖啡还有一张卡片，介绍了这款咖啡的来头，就当喝个文化吧。最搞笑的是店员不懂英文但会几句汉语，可能没少接待中国游客哈哈。</p><p><img

😅。同时这一层有好几家店的门上都贴着由“大阪府风俗环境净化协会”出具的未成年不得入内警示，我们一度怀疑找错了地方（这是什么日本电影的场景？！）。</p><p><img

Toyosu，主要原因是Eyama想一大早冲去丰洲市场逛吃海产，这家酒店步行十分即可。此外从地图上看酒店到品川区的直线距离不远，去拜访微软和谷歌的办公室应该还算方便。</p><p><img

Tokyo，又因疫情滞留在上海办公一段时间，来苏州面基吃饭赏湖景，大家结下深厚友谊。去年上海放开之后她终于办理好手续登陆东京，这次来前也约好请她带我们参观谷歌的办公室。</p><p>在微信上跟她说明情况之后，她表示可以去她家休息，她去公寓的自习室学习（准备日语考试）。这对我来说无疑是救命稻草，立马出发，Eyama也跟我一起坐公交去市区吃东西。这里还有个小插曲，到大阪的第一天取完现金后我要分给Eyama，他表示没带小包不方便装钱，况且绝大多数时间都是一起行动没必要。结果他中午在一家人气小店排了很长的队伍后发现店家只收现金，欲哭无泪。</p><p>Lq住在五反田附近，公交车坐到中央区后再转地铁。高轮台地铁站，看起来有些年头。</p><p><img

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>身为拖延症重症患者，这篇四月底出行的旅行笔记不出意外地拖到了年底。前几天本想抢到John Mayer在东京Blue Note的跨年演出票再去东京玩一趟，可惜BN座位太少又缺乏其线上抢票经验，今年应该只有四月这一次日本行。只能补上这篇流水账，温习一下短短几天的日本时光。尽管有没计划好的行程把人折腾得不行，但整体来说瑕不掩瑜，是一次美好的旅行。</p><p>写这篇文章花了十几个小时，挑选了近两百张照片，说实话是一件费时费力的事。想必正在阅读本文的你也得花上一点时间才能看完三篇文章的所有内容。也想过以后是不是直接录视频、剪辑成Vlog上传到B站、YouTube，如果要做到精益求精工作量只会更大吧。并且年更型选手不需要流量更不需要变现（也不敢想），写给自己的回忆，图文记录应该足够。一年还能写上一篇笔记，对我来说已经是一个不小的目标~</p><p>最后要说明得是文中时间均使用当地时间，在国内是国内时间，在日本则是日本时间，两者有一小时时差。</p><h2 id="04-20-出发前的失眠夜"><a href="#04-20-出发前的失眠夜" class="headerlink" title="04.20 出发前的失眠夜"></a>04.20 出发前的失眠夜</h2><p>此次和公司同事Eyama约好一同出行，我们提前订好了往返机票、酒店以及演唱会的门票，并且制定了大致的行程。由于去程航班中午出发，早上十点就得值机，在Eyama的邀请下我前一天晚上直接睡他家客房，第二天一早七点出发自驾前往上海浦东机场附近的停车场。之所以选择开车去是因为返程航班晚上十一点才到达，公共交通基本都收班了，还是自己开车回苏州靠得住。20号晚餐吃得很爽，Eyama师傅作为拿到中级厨师证的资深爱好者，做得一手好饭，我们经常来他家聚餐。</p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!35910&authkey=!ADFzSNKLrbmqAb0&width=2000&height=1500" alt="那天晚上四人聚餐的一道硬菜"></p><p>不过这一晚我几乎没睡着：可能是不习惯早睡，也可能因为床板太硬；不知为何房门不能完全关紧，从厕所窗外传来的大街上飘荡的回响听得一清二楚；他家的两只猫猫时不时钻进房间视察一下。总之就这样熬到了第二天清早…</p><h2 id="04-21-出发"><a href="#04-21-出发" class="headerlink" title="04.21 出发"></a>04.21 出发</h2><p>楼下简单吃了个早饭，便利店买几罐咖啡，我们即刻出发。今天是周五，之前担心会遇到早高峰堵车，不过运气不错一路畅通。Eyama开车，我虽然困得不行还是陪他聊了一路音乐。</p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!35906&authkey=!AFRAxzYagC2_M_s&width=1500&height=2000" alt="恐怕只有在苏州开车才懂的梗"></p><p>浦东机场卫生间外的数据大屏。现在只要上云，都要冠以“智慧” “AI” “大数据”这些噱头。</p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!35904&authkey=!AJi5YSUN12-FsbU&width=2000&height=1500"></p><p>值机后时间绰绰有余，我们来到贵宾厅小憩一下，吃点东西补充能量。出关时国内海关的工作人员在我说完去日本旅游、四五天就回后，莫名其妙来了一句“不去美国玩啊？”，我整个人懵了一下。虽然护照里有十年美签，但这是什么奇怪的联想。配合上他那似笑非笑的表情，属实让人不舒服。“不去！”。</p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!35909&authkey=!ADMOQ6iOwvcEkG4&width=2000&height=1500"></p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!35908&authkey=!AFG8ouleVuAPJOU&width=2000&height=1500"></p><p>日本时间下午三点抵达大阪关西国际机场，入关的人不多，不过后来看网上说这几天有些时段也是要排长队。我办得是五年多次往返旅游签证，单次入境最多可以待90天。</p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!38179&authkey=!APm2JyoSiqQSc6E&width=1500&height=2000"></p><p>按照当地政策，如果已经在国内接种了三针疫苗，则不用再做核酸。直接在微信小程序“防疫健康码国际版”上获取《国际旅行健康证明》，出机场时出示给工作人员看即可。此外还有一个环节需要在机场的大屏设备上登记一些东西，这才过半年已经忘了是干什么的 @_@</p><p>在搭电车去大阪市中心前，我们原本准备取点日元备用，看完机场机器上的汇率后立马劝退。Eyama已经换上提前在淘宝买的流量卡，问了下日本当地的朋友说市区便利店的汇率不错，于是我俩都只在Apple Pay上给Suica充了点钱，先坐电车到市区再说。</p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!38180&authkey=!AIveVupa8_CymU0&width=2000&height=1500"></p><h2 id="04-21-初识大阪，入住心斋桥"><a href="#04-21-初识大阪，入住心斋桥" class="headerlink" title="04.21 初识大阪，入住心斋桥"></a>04.21 初识大阪，入住心斋桥</h2><p>关西机场建在一个岛上，去市区的第一步就是过海。</p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!38181&authkey=!AMZlnPlyTliGuKE&width=2000&height=1500"></p><p>日本的酒店都是我订的（Eyama负责选餐厅），我们今晚住在心斋桥边上的东横INN酒店。电车到达难波站后，看距离不是很远我们决定步行过去。这几天Eyama都只提了一个内置保温层的大袋子，里面非常离谱地装了一位深圳朋友做得糕点，要带去东京给一群他们共同的朋友。我非常无语这群东京的人好意思让Eyama从深圳-苏州-大阪-东京这么带一路，同时这也苦了我的行李箱。因为大多时候他都把袋子放行李箱上，然后主动提出拖着箱子走。尽管路上跟他说过几次，但是一旦走得久点，Eyama就会在过马路时下意识通过拉杆直接提起箱子通过台阶，这样的后果就是回苏州时拉杆已经摇摇晃晃、命不久矣。后半段还是我自己管好箱子吧。</p><p>初到大阪的第一个深刻印象就是出租车打蜡保养得非常新。</p><p><img data-src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=7A756318060FAEEC!38189&authkey=!APbKE1JQ-61ynQA&width=2000&height=1500"></p><p><img

丽江古城与木府</h2><p>尽管前几日的行程负荷不算太大，但我一路兼顾车夫和游客的双重身份，仍有些疲惫，所以最后两天我们选择让节奏再慢一点。当然早餐还是不能落下，闹钟定在九点半，醒来拉开窗帘，让阳光照进古香古色的房间。</p><p><img

吃不惯，算难得的翻车经历吧，并且这顿是我们云南之行吃得最贵的一餐 😂。</p><p><img

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2020上半年疫情较为严重的那段时期，旅游业为了生存推出各种机酒预售套餐，三月底在阿里旅行群里看到嬉游的菜菜推荐丽江和府洲际&#x2F;英迪格酒店， 3 晚含双早和玉龙雪山门票只要￥1846，花呗囤货、不约可退，有效期至 2020 年底。要知道疫情前后 1 晚酒店加下午茶和索道就要接近两千，这谁顶得住呀，果断下手。</p><p>经历漫长拖延期后，我们在八月预约了九月底入住酒店。由于把去程机票买在丽江后才决定顺道去大理走走，租车自驾游便成为能把整个行程串联起来的上佳选择。租车也不贵，携程上选了一个高分车行，起亚 K2 （实际是同等级车型，给了我一辆奔腾 X40，这个后面再吐槽）租 3 天，异地还车，考虑要开山路加选无忧尊享服务费（无需承担含玻璃、轮胎在内的全部车辆损失）才五百多，再使用中行卡支付立减￥55，总共￥481。至于大理的酒店就随意选了一间民宿，两百多一晚含双早。</p><h2 id="09-25-出发"><a href="#09-25-出发" class="headerlink" title="09.25 出发"></a>09.25 出发</h2><p>可怜的在苏务工人员只能打车去无锡硕放机场，特意选了下午四点飞的航班，两张票加机建费一共一千四出头。出行前还收到了航司的促销短信，加百来块把座位调到第一排，好处是腿部空间宽敞许多。</p><p><img

SUV 只配了卤素灯，开灯给人的感觉就是“开了，但没全开”… 基于没什么来车的情况，安全起见，我默默打开了远光灯赶路。</p><p>经过两个小时的跋涉，我们进入大理，看到了洱海的星星点点。</p><p><img

Same thing to the other notes or scales, we have these common chords:</p><ul><li>Triads: major (1, 3, 5), minor (1, b3, 5), augmented (1, 3, #5), diminished (1, b3, b5)</li><li>7th chords: major (1, 3, 5, 7), dominant (1, 3, 5, b7), minor (1, b3, 5, b7), half diminished (1, b3, b5, b7), diminished (1, b3, b5, bb7), minor major (1, b3, 5, 7), augmented major (1, 3, #5, 7)</li></ul><h3 id="Figure-out-the-root-position-of-chords"><a href="#Figure-out-the-root-position-of-chords" class="headerlink" title="Figure out the root position of chords"></a>Figure out the root position of chords</h3><ol><li>Know the members of chord due to its type</li><li>Find the root notes on 4th to 6th strings</li><li>Find the position of other notes due to the intervals</li></ol><p>In this way we can infer 5 common patterns (R, 5, 7, 3 and R, 7, 3, 5) by CAGED system of each type of chords.</p><h3 id="Chord-scale-system"><a href="#Chord-scale-system" class="headerlink" title="Chord-scale system"></a>Chord-scale system</h3><p>The chord is equal to the scale and vice versa. Think that a heptatonic scale (like diatonic scale) is consist of 4 notes of the 7th chord which the root note is harmonized with other 3 extensions. In the other hand, 4 notes determine the type of chord, and 3 extensions determine the type of scale.

Thus leverage the harmonic minor scale (1, 2, b3, 4, 5, b6, 7) to make V to be dominant chord, but also keep the II and I chords in natural minor scale to construct the minor II-V-I.</p><p>Comparing to the V in major scale (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, b7), the V in harmonic minor scale (1, b2, 3, 4, 5, b6, 7) has b9 and b13 notes which is called altered. Typically, a dominant seventh chord is considered altered if either or both the 5th or 9th are chromatically raised or lowered (#9 or b9 and #11 or b13).</p><p>In result, the minor II-V-I is m7b5-dom7alt-min7.

When you see a G13 chord, it must comes from a major scale. And when you see a dom7b9, you can infer that it comes from the V in minor scale, then you can play phrygian dominant.</p><p>Moreover, the basic patterns to play minor II-V-I are locrian for minor II, phrygian dominant for minor V and aeolian or dorian for minor I.</p><h3 id="Avoid-note"><a href="#Avoid-note" class="headerlink" title="Avoid note"></a>Avoid note</h3><p>Avoid note will change the functionality of chords.</p><ul><li>For major and dominant chords, the avoid note is 4th diatonic scale step (11), the available extensions are 9, #11, 13.</li><li>For minors chords, the avoid note is 6th scale step (13), the available extensions are 9, 11. There is an exception, it can work if the minor chord acts as dominant function. For instance, replace V dominant by IV minor and the progression turns to be IV major, IV minor and I major, sounds great.</li></ul><p>Avoid notes for modes of the C major scale:</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center">Scale degree</th><th align="center">Chord</th><th align="center">Mode</th><th align="center">Avoid note</th><th align="center">Available tensions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">Cmaj7</td><td align="center">Ionian</td><td align="center">Fourth scale step, F</td><td align="center">9, 13</td></tr><tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">Dm7</td><td align="center">Dorian</td><td align="center">Sixth scale step, B</td><td align="center">9, 11</td></tr><tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">Em7</td><td align="center">Phrygian</td><td align="center">Second and sixth scale steps, F and C</td><td align="center">11</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">Fmaj7</td><td align="center">Lydian</td><td align="center">No avoid note</td><td align="center">9, ♯11, 13</td></tr><tr><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">G7</td><td align="center">Mixolydian</td><td align="center">Fourth scale step, C</td><td align="center">9, 13</td></tr><tr><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">Am7</td><td align="center">Aeolian</td><td align="center">Sixth scale step, F</td><td align="center">9, 11</td></tr><tr><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">Bø7</td><td align="center">Locrian</td><td align="center">Second scale step, C</td><td align="center">11, ♭13</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Steps-to-learn-a-standard"><a href="#Steps-to-learn-a-standard" class="headerlink" title="Steps to learn a standard"></a>Steps to learn a standard</h3><ol><li>Listen multiple versions of the song with lead sheet, figure out the form of the song.</li><li>Practice the melody and chords of the song.</li><li>Practice scales and arpeggios through the chords.</li><li>Improvisation.

The silent token refresh loads an iframe using that empty <code>oauth.html</code> file, and that same <code>oauth.html</code> file needs to receive the response back, so the acquire token silent flow provides the <code>/oauth.html</code> endpoint as the redirect URI. This is different from the user-facing flow because there is no iframe that the middleware loads into the page, redirecting back to <code>oauth.html</code> will not hook into React or MSAL and auth would halt – it must redirect back to your react app in the user-facing flow.</p><h4 id="Code-configuration"><a href="#Code-configuration" class="headerlink" title="Code configuration"></a>Code configuration</h4><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> config = &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">auth</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// The application ID of your AAD application</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="attr">clientId</span>: <span class="string">&quot;11111111-1111-1111-111111111111&quot;</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// The authority URL for your application</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="attr">authority</span>: <span class="string">&quot;https://login.microsoftonline.com/common&quot;</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// Defaults to application start page</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="attr">redirectUri</span>: <span class="string">&quot;https://localhost:3000&quot;</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="attr">postLogoutRedirectUri</span>: <span class="string">&quot;https://localhost:3000/logout&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> loginRequest = &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">scopes</span>: [<span class="string">`<span class="subst">$&#123;resourceEndpoint&#125;</span>/.default`</span>]</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h4 id="Authority"><a href="#Authority" class="headerlink" title="Authority"></a>Authority</h4><p>The authority is a URL that indicates a directory that MSAL can request tokens from, for more details check the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-client-application-configuration">MSAL Application configuration options</a>.</p><h4 id="Scopes-and-permissions"><a href="#Scopes-and-permissions" class="headerlink" title="Scopes and permissions"></a>Scopes and permissions</h4><p>Applications that integrate with the Microsoft identity platform follow an authorization model that gives users and administrators control over how data can be accessed. <code>/.default</code> represents OpenID Connect scopes, for more details check the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent">Permissions and consent in the Microsoft identity platform</a>.</p><h3 id="Sign-in-with-redirect"><a href="#Sign-in-with-redirect" class="headerlink" title="Sign-in with redirect"></a>Sign-in with redirect</h3><p>It’s no need to redirect to sign-in page every time if auth is not expired, just go ahead.

When no valid token is in the cache, it sends a silent token request to AAD from a hidden iframe.</p><p>The silent token requests to AAD might fail for reasons like an expired Azure AD session or a password change.

If you don’t have any idea about this section, the official document explains <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-migration#why-switch-to-msal">Why switch to MSAL</a> clearly.</p><h3 id="Tips"><a href="#Tips" class="headerlink" title="Tips"></a>Tips</h3><ul><li>You may need to change the reply URL type from <code>Web</code> to <code>SPA</code> as MSAL.js required. AdalJS supports both two types, so this change will not block online client services.</li><li>Need to specify the <code>accessTokenAcceptedVersion</code> to <code>2</code> and <code>signInAudience</code> to <code>AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount</code> in the manifest if you want to support both AAD account and MSA account. These settings will not break online client services as well.</li><li>You can just import the MSAL.js distribution script to your app then test if the current AAD configurations are satisfying both SDKs.</li><li>If there is an auth service for the app, you can just do <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/login-user.md#silent-login-with-ssosilent">silent login with <code>ssoSlient()</code></a>.</li><li>Remember to test all kinds of audiences of the customers and all provided resouce endpoints with access token.</li></ul><h3 id="Quick-login-verification-on-you-app-page"><a href="#Quick-login-verification-on-you-app-page" class="headerlink" title="Quick login verification on you app page"></a>Quick login verification on you app page</h3><p>PoC (Proof of concept) or verfication always needs quick moves. For the migration scenario, we have to make sure the AAD configurations are correct as well as compatible to make both AdalJS clients and MSAL.js clients login successfully at first stage. To do the quick login verification, the authentication client class need to be exposed to <code>Window</code> global no matter AdalJS or MSAL.js, then we can do experiment on the console of browser.</p><h4 id="For-MSAL-js"><a href="#For-MSAL-js" class="headerlink" title="For MSAL.js"></a>For MSAL.js</h4><p>Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/initialization.md">document</a>, it’s similar to the codes demonstrated above.</p><h4 id="For-AdalJS"><a href="#For-AdalJS" class="headerlink" title="For AdalJS"></a>For AdalJS</h4><p>The docs for AdalJS are much fewer than MSAL.js probably becasue it has been deprecated. And different versions of AdalJS seems to have few subtle API as well as behavior changes, so you may need to update the code below to make it work.

So the question is how to debug or do verification?</p><p>Basically you can run a local server to host your application with adding a host record which points the production host to your local IP address like <code>127.0.0.1</code> to make it. Remember to enable HTTPS protocol for your local server.</p><p>And it’s better to verify your change on both common window and incognito window after the release.</p><h3 id="Difference-between-access-token-ID-token-and-refresh-token"><a href="#Difference-between-access-token-ID-token-and-refresh-token" class="headerlink" title="Difference between access token, ID token, and refresh token"></a>Difference between access token, ID token, and refresh token</h3><p>We observed that <code>/oauth2/v2.0/token</code> return 3 tokens: <code>access_token</code>,  <code>id_token</code> and <code>refresh_token</code>.</p><p><code>access_token</code> enables clients to securely call protected web APIs, and are used by web APIs to perform authentication and authorization. For more details please check <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens">Microsoft identity platform access tokens</a>.</p><p><code>id_token</code> should be used to validate that a user is who they claim to be and get additional useful information about them, it can be sent alongside or instead of an access token. We have not used it. For more details please check <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens">Microsoft identity platform ID tokens</a>.</p><p><code>access_token</code> and <code>id_token</code> are both JWT which consists of a header, payload, and signature portion, that’s why they look so similiar though these two strings are base64 encoded. We mainly use access token for the application, it contains more information than ID token, and we can get user info like name, E-mail from it.</p><p>Because access tokens are valid for only a short period of time, authorization servers will sometimes issue a refresh token at the same time the access token is issued. MSAL.js will exchange the <code>refresh_token</code> while request token silently for a new access token when needed.</p><h3 id="How-to-change-token-expiration-time"><a href="#How-to-change-token-expiration-time" class="headerlink" title="How to change token expiration time?"></a>How to change token expiration time?</h3><p>Please check this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31162257/azure-oauth-how-to-change-token-expiration-time">answer from StackOverflow</a>.</p><h3 id="InteractionRequiredAuthError-AADSTS50058-A-silent-sign-in-request-was-sent-but-no-user-is-signed-in"><a href="#InteractionRequiredAuthError-AADSTS50058-A-silent-sign-in-request-was-sent-but-no-user-is-signed-in" class="headerlink" title="InteractionRequiredAuthError: AADSTS50058: A silent sign-in request was sent but no user is signed in."></a>InteractionRequiredAuthError: AADSTS50058: A silent sign-in request was sent but no user is signed in.</h3><p>This error need interaction sign in, thus catch the error and call <code>acquireTokenRedirect</code> method to sign in.</p><p>If the error message contains like this “The cookies used to represent the user’s session were not sent in the request to Azure AD.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>各位新春快乐！</p><p>很早就想创建一个音乐分类，不如就在新年伊始开个头，简单碎碎念几句。</p><span id="more"></span><p>我从十几年前开始喜欢 John Mayer，那个时候就埋下想练好吉他的种子。可惜最初没钱拜师且忙于学业，再到工作后的 996 社畜模式，尽管手边一直有“烧火棍”陪伴，但也就随便摸摸便点到即止。从最早的土豆、优酷到 YouTube 再到 B 站，零零散散的教学视频也刷了不少，绝大多数都是脑子懂手不会，碎片化的知识也不成体系。</p><p>蹉跎数载，转眼临近 30，在去年申博因为不可抗拒因素黄了之后，我便开始思考业余时间的分配。去年恰逢疫情，身为武汉人身心多少受到些影响，我找到的第一个放松方式是打王者荣耀，并在半年后成功上了王者段位（单排三排对半）。除此之外，我逐渐抛开以往学琴要跟着本地老师的观念，想着要不要报个网课试试。除了忙之外，之前一直没线下跟过老师的主要原因还是没看到特别靠谱的，虽然俺菜，但不妨碍我信息广、要求高，并且我希望能长期跟着一位或几位优秀的老师进行体系化的学习，不是随便学几首曲子就完事。</p><p>受疫情影响，线上教学的课程越来越多。B 站上优秀的乐手不少，基本都支持网络教学。我喜欢 John Mayer，也从读研参加爵士社团开始接触和喜欢爵士乐，关注的老师风格类型自然是以爵士和布鲁斯为主。在接近一年的观察中，蔡剑是我听过讲解这类风格最清楚的老师之一，他不仅是业内知名的爵士吉他演奏家，同时还是星海音乐学院的教师，有专业的教育学背景。除了业务素质过硬外，听他谈一些音乐观念也比较中肯，谦虚耿直的态度我非常喜欢。最后中文全网搜索蔡老师的口碑都很不错，这无疑增添了我对线上课程的信心。恰好去年底蔡老师和哎呀音乐联合推出了一个培养爵士吉他老师的师资班，有较为体系的培养方案和能力检定计划，双十一还有折扣，我就毫不犹豫报名上车了。尽管还是很担心时间不够用，不过趁 30 之前，冲一把！</p><p>事实证明课程质量不错，除了有蔡老师的大课外，还有三位小课老师答疑、点评大家的作业以及补充小课。过年这段时间还有额外的基本功补习，小课老师带着大家一点点啃音阶和乐句，教我们如何高效地练习，对我们这些“差等生”来说非常受用。不过随之而来的就是课程强度很高，想拿高分不易。同班同学不少已经跟着蔡老师学过几年，其中绝大部分都是以音乐为生，吉他老师、职业编曲包括职业乐手都有，像我这样的纯爱好者极少，真的压力山大！</p><p>三位小课老师都是科班出身，技术上没得说，有的也很热心负责，会在微信群里详细地点评学生的作业，指出哪几个小节节奏不对或是如何学习、借鉴作业内容相似的大师作品。平台嘛马马虎虎，看起来全面贴心但实则细节不足，管理上比较随意，最让人无语的是漏统计我的期末作业。但大家都奔着蔡师去的，只能笑笑过去了。接下来会详细介绍一下我接触爵士乐的由来，毕竟前面反复提到 John Mayer，好家伙话锋一转就跑去学爵士了，这背后当然是有故事的😂。</p><p>大家可能在咖啡厅、欧美流行音乐中都或多或少听过一点爵士乐，但要说第一次正儿八经接触这种音乐形态，并让我深深爱上它，源自一场在我研究生入学没多久的爵士乐社招新演出。</p><p>那是 2014 年秋，成大爵士乐社在校园社团博览会上的表演。 露天舞台下所有人享受着美妙的音乐和社员分发的小杯鸡尾酒，炎炎夏日感受到无限清凉。 虽然这只是 LG G2 手持录制的片段，但每次看到这段回忆仍会被深深感动。说起来 G2 是最早搭载 OIS 光学防抖的手机，也是当时最窄边框的手机，我从那个时候开始就对手机拍照有较高的要求，淘了这么个韩国水货“洋垃圾”，现在回看当年拍的照片和视频也算能入眼，深感欣慰！</p><div style="position:

framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe></div><p>没有任何迟疑，我立即报名参加了爵士乐社，在此期间参加了几次社内的培训活动，了解了爵士乐的一些基本概念，甚至那会就装上了 iReal Pro，可惜荒废了这么多年！现在还能回想起，有一次大伙去一个社员家的天台烧烤，酒足饭饱，自然是 jam 时间，那种氛围真的是超级好。</p><p><img

Hi-Fi 永远都体会不到的乐趣。</p><p><img data-src="https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4md_XAHPdMiFHnawJCGYkrFAqdPmEw8_Rk0mQPrAM6WyVL5m2mkD62Dd9NTCdIgWgjHxDL1NtZI61cVZ7rr7ie5kKO3P68Rm6VRPzXOnmusdIc6B3WL4ohzgmAN00uvXoDYAsDnTlXVIPSm1BhwmdDaHNiht2HCWdrzzmpKPmbv5NH6yUw3Eg-vzj58EudwHO1?width=4160&height=2340&cropmode=none"></p><p>那一届爵士研习营请来了美国的爵士电颤琴演奏家 Tony Miceli，尽管我当时无法辨别他的技术有多牛，不过仍记得他的演奏音乐性很强，能打动我这么一个小白，简单说就是好听。在他的乐理课程上，他要求我们每个人根据和声弹点东西，轮到我时我说不会，他说不要紧，无论你弹什么，你至少要弹几个音符给我。更囧的是，我当时带的还是一把没拾音器的箱琴，和我的看客身份简直绝配😅。其实我是一个自尊心很强的人，在研习营第一天发现自己与环境格格不入后，就有过想走的念头。已经忘记当时是和哪位老师交流，他劝我先留下来跟着听听再说，真的感谢他的建议，我也做到了！</p><p><img

jam 活动，研习营的一大好处就是为营员创造了大量演出机会，只要想表演就上。说起来虽然东华大学音乐系的爵士组一直没有爵士吉他教师，但研习营还是欢迎吉他手参加，并邀请来了曾给《中国好歌曲》《中国梦之声》、刘若英、蔡健雅、丁当等等节目和歌手巡演做过电吉他手的邱安炜老师，专门给我们上了一节分享课。课上的 Q&amp;A 环节我厚着脸皮问老师，对于我这种零基础的人该怎么学琴，老师非常详细地介绍了他学琴、练琴过程中不断检视自己的几个方面，当下就有不少顿悟。小炜老师当时拿了一把 James Tyler 的琴，那也是我第一次认识这个品牌。</p><p><img data-src="https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4ms5Xw0b3y-Wf2ydxyGfZR2Cv-io59oVd_kDs82PJQ2xWHwnVGgktIAu7zm92vszcVNsTHY8H-ciXmCGGPdlicbOkgca21Hn3sqXnSrad_LcAKvXFGA-Px6VV6syNZyRqAZBk5pQIW5a2bg4I9bgu-Oem1QousodJnV8BcKDB7ZRAsgsLFJ-n1BF9CrUOcGBJe?width=4160&height=2340&cropmode=none"></p><p>研习营非常有心，除了演奏家、职业乐手外，还请来了一位业内非常资深的音控师高敏福老师，给大家分享现场演出时的调音知识。</p><p><img data-src="https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4mnT3r7mzngYtPZXnz9HAoVZYh6GeqhW4g6vN79YTnsiAJ_E1n8Npr54ux046-SmhLX85_Eq9_wiWbm8tBEYnhcXWuSGEr5eMFnFIhkGb6Q1pJ6czKfP5Yyf5kFcrMR0LRu6d4-TOaYImLj1eD7SF_6kA_e4HmI_zDV3yr49OZYcUPhRUT0Cc9XpBf-xhNGFqZ?width=4160&height=2340&cropmode=none"></p><p>除了常规的教学课程外，爵士研习营的举办人之一、音乐系爵士组的领头人魏广皓教授还与大家探讨了职业发展规划的话题。别说爵士乐这种“没市场的音乐”，就算从事流行大众音乐领域想赚到钱也不容易，未来的路该怎么走值得思考。</p><p><img

If you need a package that requires a different version of Python, you do not need to switch to a different environment manager, because conda is also an environment manager. With just a few commands, you can set up a totally separate environment to run that different version of Python, while continuing to run your usual version of Python in your normal environment.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Cloud"><a href="#Cloud" class="headerlink" title="Cloud"></a>Cloud</h3><p>It’s cloud computing era, we can write and save our code on the cloud and run it at anytime with any web client. Two cloud platforms will be introduced here, I suggest you try both of them and enjoy your experiment.</p><p>More specifically, these two products are all based on <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, which provides flexible Python runtime and Markdown document feature, it’s easy to run code snippet just like on the local terminal.</p><h4 id="Notebooks-of-Azure-Machine-Learning-Studio"><a href="#Notebooks-of-Azure-Machine-Learning-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Notebooks of Azure Machine Learning Studio"></a>Notebooks of Azure Machine Learning Studio</h4><p>Here is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-run-jupyter-notebooks">brief introduction</a> of Notebooks of AML Studio, the advantages of this product are:</p><ul><li>IntelliSense and Monaco Editor adopted from Visual Studio Code are great.</li><li>Rich sample notebooks are provided, and the tab view allows user to open several documents with several file types in one page.</li><li>An one-stop platform for user to develop their machine learning project, you can take it as cloud IDE (Integrated Development Environment). For example, user can manager their huge datasets by Datasets, and then consume them in Notebooks.</li></ul><p><img

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>在正文开始前，请允许我碎碎念一下。</p><p>我从小喜欢数码产品，各种拆解、修复，初中开始靠使电烙铁拿奖中考加分… 一直以来身边人购置数码产品或者遇到问题都会咨询我，但我好像越长大越懒得折腾这些东西，热情逐渐被岁月磨灭（？）。难得有兴趣在换手机时做个简短的对比评测，就借此机会多写一点吧。</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="我的玩机历史"><a href="#我的玩机历史" class="headerlink" title="我的玩机历史"></a>我的玩机历史</h2><p>我从高中开始放飞自我，因为囊中羞涩主要倒腾各种二手手机，在此之前只玩过小灵通和 MOTO V3（向永恒的 Razor 系列致敬！）。那会正是诺基亚如日中天的时候，Symbian S40&#x2F;S60v3平台的手机相对保值，也就蹭同学的手机玩，在二手市场中没有性价比可言。我则从Sony（黑白机）、Sony Ericsson（自研系统和 Symbian OS）、MOTO（自研 Linux 系统和 Windows Phone）、三星（自研系统、Symbian OS 和 Windows Phone）、HP（Windows Phone）到多普达以及 HTC 贴各种运营商牌的 Windows Phone，各种体验、刷机、维修和转卖，度过了高中三年时光。这些手机便宜，但绝大多数内置强大的操作系统，更具体讲可以安装各种应用软件，在还是 GPRS 网络和 Java 小游戏的年代已经具备一定的可玩性。</p><p>记得高三那年 iPhone 3GS 发布，当时还觉得平平无奇，就是贵。而初次见到 HTC Hero G3 被鲜艳的大屏和 UI 震撼到了，开始入坑 Android。大学时主要有两台神机令我印象深刻，持有时间最长。</p><p>第一部是 MOTO Defy，简直是当时的性价比之王，两千元左右的价格配置全面，陪我度过了两年的时光。还记得那时候就开始玩 Real Racing 3，没想到这款游戏在近 10 年后的今天仍然占据着 Android 热门赛车游戏的一席之地，还被 EA 收购了。</p><p>第二部则是 LG G2，这部手机是当时全球最窄边框的智能手机，外观在今天看来仍不过时，非常的“现代化”。除此之外，性能不必多说，还有两大卖点。一是 LCD 的屏幕出自自家 LG Display，是全球最好的 LCD 屏幕没有之一，iPhone 也用的它家屏幕，这和我后来选三星类似。另一卖点则是用上了 OIS 光学防抖的摄像头，这个配置如今司空见惯，但在当年真是鹤立鸡群的技术，拍照素质自然秒杀其他手机一截。这也是我第一次玩韩版机，到三星时代因为指纹支付问题以及蛋疼的系统已经不再碰它们了。</p><p>随后就有点平淡无奇，不爱折腾了，就开始保持品牌忠诚度。我选手机的标准很明确，当下旗舰机保证基本门槛，在此基础上依照拍照、屏幕、 续航、扬声器、是否支持无线充电（从 S7E 尝到甜头开始）、是否支持IP68 防尘防水（依然是从 S7E 开始提高要求）为顺序做挑选。实际的换机轨迹在 G2 之后是 G Pro 2、G3 和 G4，直到 G4 出现大面积主板故障，同时三星的双相位对角、曲面屏开始惊艳市场后，入坑 S7E、S8+ 和 Note9。</p><h2 id="关于米-10-Pro"><a href="#关于米-10-Pro" class="headerlink" title="关于米 10 Pro"></a>关于米 10 Pro</h2><p>去年差点入坑 1+7 Pro，不过之前玩过二手的 1+3T 对拍照表现不太满意，以及看过 1+7 Pro 的各种评测，觉得不少细节还是差点意思（如在 2019 年仍不支持无线充电），于是放弃。直到今年初，三星的系统“负优化”在玩 30 帧“王者荣耀”时竟然会偶尔卡顿，续航也开始退化，决定换其他厂牌，考察一圈最终选择米10 Pro。</p><p>其实这个选择挺容易做的，MIUI 的优化加各种顶配硬件不仅玩游戏体验远胜 Note9，屏幕还是三星家的 A 货，双扬声器在每次 B 站评测中总能引来“全体起立”（毫不夸张讲是我到目前为止听过最棒的手机外放）的弹幕，以及今天要对比的 DXO 评分 124 分的拍照功能，基本上很难找到对手。说起来我对价格不算太敏感，也考虑过 S20+ 甚至 S20 Ultra，不过想到那个“慢吞吞”的 One UI ROM 还是算了吧，S20 Ultra 还被一众测评指出固件并不完善。</p><p>一开始抱着不好用就再卖掉的心态使了两天米 10 Pro，结果它毫无悬念的在绝大多数方面体验完胜 Note9，导致后者被我秒出。除了上述的优点外，米 10 Pro 的背面磨砂玻璃手感很不错，挖孔屏实际带来的干扰也比我想象中要小不少，果然是看习惯就好。而 Note9 还能胜过米 10 Pro 的地方有二：</p><ul><li><p>系统更纯净，也就是大家吐槽已久的 MIUI 广告问题。确实通过各种设置可以关掉绝大多数 MIUI 上的广告，只是我不太理解把这些“狗屁膏药”贴在自己旗舰上真的能增加更多营收吗，要知道这一点劝退了不少人。而我个人认为这会培养消费者对小米品牌的负面认知，这些“狗皮膏药”始终让小米看起来不像真旗舰机。据说把系统改成英文就没这困扰了，um… 🙄 。</p></li><li><p>品控不太好。每年网上吐槽小米手机质量的声音不少，例如出名的断流问题。我对这些问题算是比较包容的态度，实际我手上这台也还没遇到断流等“硬伤”问题。不过我遇到了一个玩机这么多年头次见的小问题，屏幕边缘居然有黑胶，这会导致裸机状态下手感大打折扣。而我作为一个轻度强迫症患者，看到这个瑕疵也是不能忍，弄了半天却没法完全弄掉。还好戴套之后眼不见心不烦。</p><p><img

id="拍照对比总结"><a href="#拍照对比总结" class="headerlink" title="拍照对比总结"></a>拍照对比总结</h2><p>回归正题，在 DXO 上米 10 Pro 的评分比三星 Note9 高了有足足 21 分，那么实际成片效果是否如此，就用我五一前几天随手拍的一些样张作为对比吧。三星 Note9 的固件是 4 月最新的版本，已经用上了 Android 10，不过后续的 OTA 更新基本就是安全补丁，印象中没看到相机方面的优化；而米 10 Pro 的固件是 MIUI 11.0.16.0 稳定版。</p><p>先说结论，拍照方面无论是成像素质还是拍摄场景的多面性，米10 Pro 都毫无疑问比 Note9 强得多，照片文件大小前者是后者的一倍左右，而前者的超广角镜头和多倍混合光学变焦也是后者无法企及的。Note9 唯一值得说道还是它的调色，暖色调、高饱和度、高对比度，某些场景下拍出的照片第一眼讨喜。此外米 10 Pro 偶尔会出现白平衡不准的情况，后面会有照片说明。</p><p>那么开始看照片吧，默认同一内容的两张照片第一张出自 Note9（毕竟是前辈嘛）米 10 Pro 随后，均使用默认配置项，大概也就是使用主摄像头、开启 AI 场景识别优化。我会基于过去玩单反（Pentax 配三饼干）的经验简单评价照片，并选出我更喜欢的一边。这是一件非常主观的事，不过鄙人拍照的初衷就是记录生活、愉悦自己 :)</p><h2 id="样张对比"><a href="#样张对比" class="headerlink" title="样张对比"></a>样张对比</h2><p>公寓的走廊，很明显米 10 Pro 的主摄视角比 Note9

中雙循環鏈表的實作很類似。首先定義一個只包含前後指針的結構體 <code>_twin_queue</code>，然後內嵌到一個含有數據資源的結構體 <code>_twin_timeout</code> 中。這樣的將指針從具體的數據結構中提取出來的做法，構成了一種通用的雙向鏈表實現。其優點是未來只需要編寫通用鏈表函式，即可構造和操作不同對象的鏈表，而無需爲每類對象的每種列表編寫專用函式，實現了代碼的重用。</li><li>目前用到了兩個隊列（第三個 <code>_twin_file</code> 暫時未使用），分別是 <code>_twin_timeout</code> 超時隊列和 <code>_twin_work</code> 工作隊列，均嵌套了 <code>_twin_queue</code> 結構。<ul><li>對隊列的各項操作，例如刪除、移除等均相同；</li><li>而像插入、重新排序因爲隊列的性質不同，排序的標準也不同（超時隊列會使用時間排序，而工作隊列會使用優先級），這樣就引入一個額外的參數——隊列的程式指針（<code>_twin_timeout_order</code> 和 <code>_twin_work_order</code>）。</li></ul></li><li>相比 linux kernel 中爲了訪問到宿主結構體的巨集定義 <code>offset</code> <code>typeof</code> <code>containerof</code>，這裏要簡單很多。在宿主結構體 <code>_twin_timeout</code> 的第一項成員即包含節點指針的 <code>twin_queue_t</code> 結構體， <code>queue</code> 的起始地址即 <code>timeout</code> 的起始地址。因此在 <code>_twin_queue_set_order()</code> 函式返回 <code>head</code> 這個 <code>queue</code> 的結構體地址後，強行轉換爲 <code>twin_timeout_t</code> 類型就可以得到 <code>head</code> 的宿主結構體了。</li><li>這裏也就是 <code>clock</code> 的 <code>timeout</code> 指向 <code>head </code>，因此 <code>first</code> 得到了 <code>clock</code> 的 <code>timeout</code> 結構體地址。</li></ul></li><li><p>後面這個迴圈的執行流程爲判斷超時隊列中成員的時間標籤，如果已經是過去式，則重新執行成員自帶的程式（這裏是呼叫 <code>_twin_clock_timeout</code>，會重畫 <code>clock</code> 的 <code>toplevel</code> 並加入到超時隊列中）。執行完畢後檢查是否還未到執行時間，若是則更新該成員的時間並重新對隊列進行排序，否則從隊列中刪除該成員。這樣做的目的就是不斷找出時間戳爲過去的成員，執行他們的任務並更新他們的時間。</p></li></ul><h3 id="twin-run-work"><a href="#twin-run-work" class="headerlink"
