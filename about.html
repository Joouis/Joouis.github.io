## About

I, John Chou, am a software engineer living in Tainan, Taiwan. Currently, I'm obtaining master degree of Electronic Enineering at National Cheng Kung University. 

I started to write drivers of MCUs by myself, like 8051, STM32F1xx, STM32F4xx when I was a undergraduate student in my third year. And then I fell in love with programming. After I coming to NCKU, I started to know the whole shape of computer science gradually, and know what is open source.

The only working experience I have is, working as an intern software engineer in Lilee Systems during 2015/07 - 2015/09, taking charge of the implementation of features of new product.
