## Goal

This is the sharing session for my team, the goal is to quick ramp up the essential knowledges for linear regression case to experience how machine learning works during 1 hour. This sharing will recap basic important concepts, introduce runtime environments, and go through the codes on Notebooks of Azure Machine Learning Studio platform.

## Recap of basic concepts

**Do not worry about these theories if you can't catch up, just take it as an intro.**

### Steps of machine learning

0. Get familiar with dataset, do preprocessing works.
1. Define the model, like linear model or neural network.
2. Define the goodness/cost of model, metrics can be error, cross entropy, etc.
3. Calculate the best function by optimization algorithms.

### Linear model

Let's start with the simplest linear model $f(x)=wx+b$, you can also try more complex model if you get trouble in underfitting.

*Question: How to initialize parameters?*

### Generalization

The model's ability to adapt properly to new, previously unseen data, drawn from the same distribution as the one used to create the model.

![Goodness of fit, https://bit.ly/2JhniSc](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*iiPH0JyowvS3k12T0-W2HA.png)

- Underfitting: model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data (large bias)
- Overfitting: model is too complex relative to the amount and noisiness of the training data (large variance)

*Solutions: [References and resources](#References-and-resources), or [Underfitting and Overfitting in machine learning and how to deal with it](https://towardsdatascience.com/underfitting-and-overfitting-in-machine-learning-and-how-to-deal-with-it-6fe4a8a49dbf).*

### Loss/Cost function

There is a dataset for training, it looks like: $(x^1, \hat{y}^1)$, $(x^2, \hat{y}^2)$, ..., $(x^n, \hat{y}^n)$. The error of $x^i$ should be $\hat{y}^i-f(x)^i$, we can add all errors of data to define our loss function:

$$L(f)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\hat{y}^i-f(x^i))^2$$

$$L(w,b)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\hat{y}^i-(wx^i+b))^2$$

Obviously the smaller loss, the better model. So our target function should be:

$$f^\ast=\arg\min_{f} L(f)$$

Average value would be better than total sum, then we get the actual function that needs to be computed:

$$w^\ast,b^\ast=\arg\min_{w,b} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(\hat{y}^i-(wx^i+b))^2$$

Not big deal, just minimize the mean square error of our trivial linear model.

### Vectorized form

You may have heard "feature" before, for each of data $x^i$, if the number of its features is $m$, then the actual model should be:

$$\hat{y}^i=w_0+w_1x_1^i+w_2x_2^i+\cdots+w_mx_m^i$$

Kind of verbose right? Let's use $\mathbf{w}$ to represent all feature weights $w_1$ to $w_m$ as well as the bias term $w_0$, which called $b$ before. Same way, use $\mathbf{x}$ to represent all the feature values $x_1$ to $x_m$ with $x_0$ is equal to 1. Then we can transform linear regression model to the vectorized form:

$$\hat{y}=h_w(x)=\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}$$

Thus our loss function of vectorized form is:

$$\mathbf{w}^\ast=\frac{1}{n}\min_\mathbf{w} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(\hat{y}^i- \mathbf{w}^i\mathbf{x}^i)^2$$

Notice that $\mathbf{w}$ actually is $n*m$-dimensional matrix.

In addition, deep learning depends on matrix calculations especially, it will take advantage of GPU to speed up model training.

### Closed-form solution

As we already know the values of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\hat{y}$, it's easy to calculate the $\mathbf{w}$ by Normal Equation:

$$\hat{\mathbf{w}}=(\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{x})^{-1} \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y}$$

Check out this [online course video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/machine-learning/normal-equation-2DKxQ) (about 16min) from Andrew Ng to learn more.

Yes we're done. Our introduction is here 🤣🤣🤣 .

*Question: How to deal with complex models? How about computation burden?*

### Gradient Descent

> Gradient Descent is a **generic optimization algorithm** capable of finding optimal solution to a wide range of problems.
>
> Gradient descent is a **first-order iterative optimization algorithm** for finding a **local minimum** of a differentiable function.

Our loss function is differentiable indeed, so we can use it to find the local minimum (also the global minimum in this case). Let's get it by one chart.

![Gradient Descent, Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurélien Géron](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4mswG2flLOQG4BTxY2uv3jiGs1IbQ-VM8thBntnOmrtvJQGlthgCzW7nBj8fwkl6U7b1691jBXGBjxtsDb7dy7LF-FpJSTKouUhtfbrCRbZNUJNXt5M9WReSQKxdklCkhd7TNteQmNzZv89yr7hdMqCCgqKV9LZ1JK3nb1eWnNb2FohaTkcKiTTaVnezOQubsJ?width=2394&height=1186&cropmode=none)

So here is the last equation in this post (I promise, typing these LaTeX expressions really wore me out 🥲 ), the gradient of our loss function:

$$\nabla{L} = \frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{\mathbf{w}}} = 2 \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(\hat{y}^i- \mathbf{w}^i\mathbf{x}^i) -\mathbf{x}^i$$

*Question: disadvantages of gradient descent?*

![Gradient Descent pitfalls, Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurélien Géron](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4mXviZ8mp3JlnWxYxmhq62tUPn4MF0xLkK7Q-K63Mn1JsJwcX3tNZN2CpkbdT-3VuMKMcw_CAxtWu4XpjltS_VSYB35RZavo_zgNKd43bf3fATQhFMWbFU4v9GiYmbrTSYwbrExykkH7yZdYqKDRej4IN94CuZmKQ234pffSK3cXTPtQBQlDJgUGdySnzqIxsL?width=2554&height=1150&cropmode=none)

#### Variants optimizers

- SGD, Stochastic gradient descent
- Adam
- Mini-batch gradient descent
- Adagrad

### Training tips

Probably it's enough for us to dig into the code, so the recap should be stopped here. At last, giving this tips section for some practical training techniques.

- Hyperparameters tuning/optimization, like pick a good learning rate
- L2 (Ridge) regularization
- Early stopping
- Feature engineering
  - Feature selection by recursive feature elimination and cross-validation ([RFECV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV.html))
    ![Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation, https://scikit-learn.org](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_rfe_with_cross_validation_001.png)
  - Feature scaling like normalization
  - Data correction for dirty part
  - Defining and removing outliers
  - Update model to make it fits dataset better like add high order term for most important feature, or even you can use a neural network if you want 😏
- Leveraging K-fold cross validation to split data and evaluate model performance



## Runtime environments

### Local

I highly recommend using Conda to run your Python code even on Unix-like OS, and [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is good to get start.

> Conda as a package manager helps you find and install packages. If you need a package that requires a different version of Python, you do not need to switch to a different environment manager, because conda is also an environment manager. With just a few commands, you can set up a totally separate environment to run that different version of Python, while continuing to run your usual version of Python in your normal environment.

### Cloud

It's cloud computing era, we can write and save our code on the cloud and run it at anytime with any web client. Two cloud platforms will be introduced here, I suggest you try both of them and enjoy your experiment.

More specifically, these two products are all based on [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), which provides flexible Python runtime and Markdown document feature, it's easy to run code snippet just like on the local terminal.

#### Notebooks of Azure Machine Learning Studio

Here is a [brief introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-run-jupyter-notebooks) of Notebooks of AML Studio, the advantages of this product are:

- IntelliSense and Monaco Editor adopted from Visual Studio Code are great.
- Rich sample notebooks are provided, and the tab view allows user to open several documents with several file types in one page.
- An one-stop platform for user to develop their machine learning project, you can take it as cloud IDE (Integrated Development Environment). For example, user can manager their huge datasets by Datasets, and then consume them in Notebooks.

![UI of Notebooks of AML Studio](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4mVzdYhgME6-tYW9V4iodQjd8ZGVolggW_QrIVVi7OBFvv9C494-pDIQWqIEXTEG0deUyGt2-qNPjCXaGqT6293-Np1Yu1c8hjzEDJ9s4iBPqEL46ozLixi9EEYOkxdxWWmIYvnWUNvMueLGo0e49t4Ehk1grxvjktySD-POZs99Lr55eWrudDri_FRPWrBbp3?width=4912&height=2582&cropmode=none)

#### Google Colaboratory

You can open `ipynb` file on Google Drive by this product, there are also several advantages:

- Cleaner and larger workspace.
- "Code snippets" feature is interesting, but not smart enough (like intelligent recommendation), nor rich code exmaples.
- It will create compute target or VM (virtual machine) for the user automatically.
- Download dataset from Google Drive, comment and share are easily.

![UI of Google Colab](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4m4TYqChfysvCych0mZCpkGZGtmeEfUG9xVf6JTxgM-Sz4yGPHf1hyj896FPnCMHhMQ2qcW3eX0Iovun58Z2kZpJmsawXKw6L5TCteeLHN9D-oGU9rx9jh3JKsOGlSfBOCYaopT_SAkW7KFeKMwuWUFRDeysHrBRq6XpC0acgQECj73BMDC7bEqIhPqtz9fdoP?width=4908&height=2568&cropmode=none)



## Code snippets

You can check sample code on Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/131sSqmrmWXfjFZ3jWSELl8cm0Ox5ah3C), and codes below will has slight differences.

### Target

To predict the PM2.5 value of first ten hour by other nine hours data.

### Data preprocessing

Original data structure looks like this:

|                     | 00:00 | 01:00 | ...  | 23:00 |
| ------------------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| Feature 1 of day 1  |       |       |      |       |
| Feature 2 of day 1  |       |       |      |       |
| ...                 |       |       |      |       |
| Feature 17 of day 1 |       |       |      |       |
| Feature 18 of day 1 |       |       |      |       |
| Feature 1 of day 2  |       |       |      |       |
| Feature 2 of day 2  |       |       |      |       |
| ...                 |       |       |      |       |

24 columns represent 24 hours, 18 features with every first 20 days of month in one year, we have $18\ast20\ast12=4320$ rows.

![Dataset preview in AML Studio](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4miEc2E3IYCgCW6s4HLzCG2UbXLQq06M1mHKngJEc47T_2tOPbEbUauwXD-OGPBCh7XLoSniII63LuBeDE4hy65w2ChXih8w-bwnW6fFdg8KyWdbsCEVVgEHgoBvcBz2yZeJ29YyqFia0J12BoRMs5qmb_YH2A5LPUzGF7m1eKSbyhEam0B3KRn771YNioLjef?width=4904&height=2598&cropmode=none)

Our target data structure of $\mathbf{X}$ will be:

|                    | Feature 1 of 1st hour | Feature 1 of 2nd hour | ...  | Feature 1 of 9th hour | Feature 2 of 1st hour | ...  | Feature 18 of 9th hour |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---- | ---------------------- |
| 10th hour of day 1 |                       |                       |      |                       |                       |      |                        |
| 11st hour of day 1 |                       |                       |      |                       |                       |      |                        |
| ...                |                       |                       |      |                       |                       |      |                        |
| 24th hour of day 1 |                       |                       |      |                       |                       |      |                        |
| 1st hour of day 2  |                       |                       |      |                       |                       |      |                        |
| ...                |                       |                       |      |                       |                       |      |                        |

Number of columns should be $18\ast9=162$, and rows should be $(20\ast24-9)\ast12=5652$.

#### Preprocessing

You may wonder why variable $\mathbf{X}$ is capital and variable $\mathbf{y}$ is lower-case, just Google matrix notation.

```python
# Remove first useless columns: ID, Date, Feature name
data = data.iloc[:, 3:]
# Replace "NR" value by 0
data[data == 'NR'] = 0
raw_data = data.to_numpy()

def cook_raw(raw_data):
  month_data = {}
  for month in range(12):
    sample = np.empty([18, 480])
    for day in range(20):
      sample[:, day * 24 : (day + 1) * 24] = raw_data[18 * (20 * month + day) : 18 * (20 * month + day + 1), :]
      month_data[month] = sample

    X = np.empty([12 * 471, 18 * 9], dtype = float)
    y = np.empty([12 * 471, 1], dtype = float)
    for month in range(12):
      for day in range(20):
        for hour in range(24):
          if day == 19 and hour > 14:
            continue
          # Vector dim: 18 * 9
          X[month * 471 + day * 24 + hour, :] = month_data[month][:,day * 24 + hour : day * 24 + hour + 9].reshape(1, -1)
          # Value
          y[month * 471 + day * 24 + hour, 0] = month_data[month][9, day * 24 + hour + 9]
    X[X < 0] = 0

    return X, y

X, y = cook_raw(raw_data=raw_data)
```

#### Feature engineering by adding quadratice equation

```python
# Polynomial regression: quadratic equation
# 10th feature is PM2.5
X = np.concatenate((X, X[:, 9*9 : 10*9] ** 2), axis=1)
```

#### Normalization

```python
# Normalization
def _normalization(X):
  # Vectors dim: 18 * 9
  mean_x = np.mean(X, axis = 0)
  std_x = np.std(X, axis = 0)
  # Length: 471 * 12
  for i in range(len(X)):
    # Length: 18 * 9
    for j in range(len(X[0])):
      if std_x[j] != 0:
        X[i][j] = (X[i][j] - mean_x[j]) / std_x[j]
  return X

X = _normalization(X)
```

#### Feature engineering by pruning unimportant features

```python
# Delete features to prevent overfitting
def prune(X):
  delete_cols = []
  # Remove trivial features: NOx(#7), RAINFALL(#11)
  remove_idx = [6, 10]
  for i in remove_idx:
    delete_cols.extend(range(i * 9 + 1, (i + 1) * 9 + 1))

  res = np.delete(X, delete_cols, 1)
  return res

# Initialize bias values with 1
X_pruned = prune(np.concatenate((np.ones([12 * 471, 1]), X), axis = 1).astype(float))
```

#### Split training data into training set and validation set

```python
X_train_set = X[: math.floor(len(x) * 0.8), :]
y_train_set = y[: math.floor(len(y) * 0.8), :]
X_validation = X[math.floor(len(x) * 0.8): , :]
y_validation = y[math.floor(len(y) * 0.8): , :]
```

### Training and prediction

#### Rough training

```python
# Loss function: RMSE
def eval_loss(X, y, w):
  return np.sqrt(np.sum(np.power(X @ w - y, 2))/X.shape[0])

# Batch gradient descent
def train(X, y, w = 0, reg = 1, iter = 8000):
  dim = X.shape[1]
  if type(w) == int:
    w = np.zeros([dim, 1])

  learning_rate = 1.6
  adagrad = np.zeros([dim, 1])
  eps = 0.0000000001
  for t in range(iter):
    loss = eval_loss(X, y, w)
    if(t%500==0):
        print('#' + str(t) + ":" + str(loss))
    # Ridge regularization
    gradient = 2 * (X.T @ (X @ w - y)) + 2 * reg * w
    # Learning schedule by Adagrad
    adagrad += gradient ** 2
    w = w - learning_rate * gradient / np.sqrt(adagrad + eps)
  return w

w = train(X_train_set, y_train_set)
```

#### Validate training

```python
eval_loss(X_validation, y_validation, w)
```

#### Training again and remove outliers

```python
w = train(X = X_pruned, y = y, w = w)

outliers = []
for i in range(X_pruned.shape[0]):
  if np.absolute(X_pruned[i] @ w - y[i]) > 10:
    outliers.append(i)

# Try to eliminate irreducible error
X_pruned = np.delete(X_pruned, outliers, 0)
y = np.delete(y, outliers, 0)

w = train(X = X_pruned, y = y, w = w)
print('\nFinal loss on full training dataset: {}'.format(eval_loss(X_pruned, y, w)))
```
