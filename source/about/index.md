# About me

Hi, this is John Chou, welcome to my personal space. You can call me **Joou** as well, it's the abbreviation of my name. There are too many John in the world, which could make "hash collision" easily. So I extract both two left and right letters in "John Chou" symmetrically and combine them into this nickname.

I like cool new techs, music especially Jazz standard and Jazz Hip hop, guitar, Manchester United and VIM. I love embedded system stuffs, as I won the first prize of Radio Production Contest in Hubei province when I was in junior high school as well as the first prize of National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest in Shandong division, and obtained EE master degree in NCKU.

But I was asked to embrace changes (which is one of the most important cultures in Alibaba) to be a F2E developer after I joined YunOS immediately... Therefore I'm focused on web front-end engineer currently, working for Machine Learning platform in Microsoft. Prior to that, I worked for Alibaba more than 2 years, developed Lazada E-commercial platform for seller part from PC web to mobile H5/Hybrid app and YunOS IDE with related tools across popular PC platforms.

If you want a referral for joining Microsoft or Alibaba, just contact me via [E-mail](mailto:luckyjoou@gmail.com). Any friendly and **interesting** discussion is also welcomed.

Have a great day!
